<h1>House of the Brotherhood</h1>

<p>Gives you points depending on the number of cloister buildings on your landscape.</p>

<p>Format is <code>U(F21,input,output)</code>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>U(F21,Ni,Rq)</pre>
<p>Eats your Nickel. Gives you a Reliquary (provided you have at least 4 cloister buildings)</p>

<pre>U(F21,PnPnPnPnWn,BoPo)</pre>
<p>Converts 4 pennies and 1 wine (used as a coin) into a book and a pottery (5 points). The 6th point here would be wasted, might be a good idea to get two pottery, but maybe you want that book for the Sacristy?</p>
