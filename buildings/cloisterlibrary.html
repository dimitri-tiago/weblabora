<h1>Cloister Library</h1>

<p>Converts up to 3 coins into 3 books. It can also convert 1 book into a meat and a wine. Awww yeah.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre>U(F17,PnPnPn,Bo)</pre>

<p>Input: 3 pennies. Output: 2 books, 1 meat, 1 wine.</p>

<pre>U(F17,Ni,Bo)</pre>
<p>Input: 1 nickel. Output: 2 pennies, 2 books, 1 meat, 1 wine. It automatically changes the nickel into 5 pennies and assumes 3 pennies into 3 books. Then converts 1 book into meat and wine somehow.</p>

<pre>U(F17,Pn,)</pre>
<p>Converts 1 penny into 1 book. That's all. The trailing comma is important.</p>

<pre>U(F17,Pn,Bo)</pre>
<p>Converts 1 penny into 1 meat and 1 wine.</p>

<pre>U(F17,,Bo)</pre>
<p>Converts 1 book into 1 meat and 1 wine. The double comma is important.</p>
