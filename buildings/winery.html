<h1>Winery</h1>

<p>Turns grapes into wine, and a single wine into 7 coins (which you usually want to do). It can also just convert a wine into 7 coins.</p>

<p>Examples:</p>

<pre>U(F21,GpGpGp,Wn)</pre>
<p>Converts 3 grapes into 3 wine, but consumes 1 of those wine to give back 7 coins.</p>

<pre>U(F21,,Wn)</pre>
<p>Doesn't convert any grapes into wine, but turns a wine into 7 coins. The double comma is important.</p>

<pre>U(F21,GpGpGpGp,)</pre>
<p>Converts 4 grapes into 4 wine. Does not turn any of those wines into coins. The trailing comma is important.</p>
