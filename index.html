        <p>Sometimes (a lot of the time) you need to do a lot of things in a turn, such as Workorder someone and then Use a building, or use a building which lets you use another building, such as the Calefactory which lets you fell trees AND cut peat. Rather than trying to figure out some sort of complicated nested nature of the U() command, the syntax just lets you string together many commands into a single move, for example:</p>
	<pre>W(WHITE,Wn)|U(F10,2,-1)|B(G39,2,-1)|U(G39,CoCo)*</pre>
	<p>This would work-contract White to do something, gifting him a wine (which is consumed). He would use the Carpentry (F10) to remove the forest at 2, -1 and then build the Estate there, and then use it with a prior (because it has an asterisk) and give it 2 coal.</p>
        <p>You're able to do a lot of things that aren't really legal moves, such as build multiple times, or Fell-Trees your entire land in one go. The players have to police things like this. The game is a little optimistic, in that it assumes players don't cheat. Rather than code as though the exceptions are the legal things, I tried to code as though the exceptions are the illegal things. Some things are caught, such as building a landscape in an illegal spot. Most things aren't.</p>
        <h4>Coordinates</h4>
        <p>The upper left square of your original 5x2 landscape is 0,0. Positive X is right, Positive Y is down. Coordinates can go negative obviously, but 0,0 always stays the origin.</p>

        <h4>Buildings</h4>
        <p>Almost all buildings consume the "resources" for their 3rd parameter of the Use command.</p>
        <p>The buildings that get you things from tokens on the wheel (Farmyard, Cloister Office, Quarry, etc) just take an input of the token. So for instance if you want to use your Clay Mound to take Clay, do U(LR1,Cl). If you want to take clay with the Joker, add Jo. The farmyard needs to know if you want sheep or grain, so if you want sheep, do U(LR2,Sh). If you want to use the farmyard to take sheep by using the joker, do U(LR2,ShJo) or U(LR2,JoSh). Order doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>Printing Office is the only building that uses more than one coordinate. You feed it coordinates of every forest you want to remove in exchange for a book.</p>
        <p>Some buildings take two resource parameters. They are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Bakery</li>
          <li>Cloister Courtyard</li>
          <li>Cloister Library</li>
          <li>Pilgrimage Site</li>
          <li>Shipping Company</li>
          <li>Winery</li>
          <li>House of the Brotherhood</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Using the Priory</h4>
        <p>To use the priory to use another building, just use the priory <code>U(G01)</code>, then use another building. Right now the game doesn't check to make sure that the building you use with it has a prior on it.</p>
